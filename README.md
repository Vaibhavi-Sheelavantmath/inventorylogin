# 🚀 Solidity Inventory Manager — Beginner Friendly Web3 DApp

## 📌 Project Description  
This project is a **beginner-friendly Web3 decentralized application (dApp)** that demonstrates how to interact with a deployed Solidity smart contract using **React, TypeScript, Wagmi, and Viem**.  

It provides a clean, simple interface for managing an **on-chain inventory system**, where users can add items and update their quantities directly on the blockchain.  

The project is structured to be easy to understand, easy to build upon, and perfect for students or beginners who want to learn how to integrate smart contracts into a front-end application.

---

## ✨ What It Does  
This dApp allows users to:

- Connect a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask)  
- Read on-chain data from a deployed Solidity contract  
- Add new inventory items  
- Update the quantity of existing items  
- View contract owner and total inventory count  
- Interact with the blockchain through a simple UI  

All actions are recorded on-chain, making the system transparent, verifiable, and trustless.

- Total `itemCount`  
- Contract `owner`

### 🔄 **Transaction Status Tracking**  
UI updates the user on:  
- Pending state  
- Confirming state  
- Confirmed state  
- Errors  

### 🧩 **Beginner-Friendly Codebase**  
- TypeScript typed hooks  
- Clean React component structure  
- Clearly commented smart contract ABI and interactions
